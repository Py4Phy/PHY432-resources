# Fix as many bugs as you can!

Debugging examples from https://py4phy.github.io/PHY432/modules/python/debugging/

Copy the `bug_*.py` files to your workspace and fix them there:

    mkdir ~/PHY432/05_debugging
    cp bug_*.py ~/PHY432/05_debugging
    cd ~/PHY432/05_debugging

Alternatively, work on [Activity
03](https://github.com/Py4Phy/Activity_03_Fix_as_many_bugs_as_possible),
which contains the same files but will also [provide tests to check
that you fixed the
bug](https://github.com/Py4Phy/Activity_03_Fix_as_many_bugs_as_possible/blob/main/README.md): 

1. [Generate your own Activity 03
   repository](https://github.com/Py4Phy/Activity_03_Fix_as_many_bugs_as_possible/generate).
2. `git clone` your repository
3. fix bugs
4. `git push` to run tests/autograder on GitHub

The
[README]((https://github.com/Py4Phy/Activity_03_Fix_as_many_bugs_as_possible/blob/main/README.md)
file explains in more detail how you can run tests locally with
`pytest` in order to check your own solution.
